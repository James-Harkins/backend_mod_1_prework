## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

The SuperLearner article resonated strongly. It was like an outline for the behavior of an autodidact.

  1. Things I already do:
      1. Read a lot. I read every day. I am working my way through a reading list I put together that will probably last me the rest of my life.
      2. View learning as a process. I am very used to the idea of learning as a process. I have played guitar for 18 years. My approach to learning new pieces of music is typically to break it down into chunks (the concept of pseudocode reminded me of chunking for guitar) and stitch the chunks together gradually, from a slowed-down tempo up to the full tempo of the piece.
      3. Teach what I learn. I have been training for strength for a few years now and took up coaching about a year ago, which has been enormously beneficial for my own training.
      4. Take care of your brain. My diet is rock solid, I sleep eight hours a night, train for strength with strict programming, and take two ten-minute walks every day.   
  2. Things I want to do more of:
      1. Establish a growth mindset. I already make a point to view obstacles as opportunities, but the word "adaptable" stuck out here. I can be stubborn and overly set in my ways, in terms of routine. I think it would be good for me to become more adaptable in this sense.
      2. Take short breaks frequently. I have a hard time stopping once I get going on a project, but I hear the argument in Mod 0 that frequent short breaks improve performance in the long run. I plan to embrace this MO.

1. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?

  puts "Hello World!"

1. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?

  #

1. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?

  Integers are whole numbers, e.g. 1, 5, 10, 100. Floats have decimals - they are more precise.

1. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`

  animal = "zebra"

1. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?

  puts animal

1. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.

  Interpolation is the embedding of a variable into a string. Example:

  puts "I saw a #{animal} at the zoo the other day."

1. What method is used to get input from a user?

  gets

1. Name and describe two common string methods:

  .length = This method will return the number of characters in the string to which it is applied.
  .split = This method will return an array of each substring separated by some specified character, e.g., spaces (by default), commas (.split(","), etc.
