# Section 4 - Objects, Classes and Code Challenges

Section 4 is estimated to take a total of 10-14 hours to complete. Similar to the previous sections, this section of pre-work involves reading üìí, üë®üèæ‚Äçüíªexercises, and üìùreflection questions. Make sure to manage your time well so that should you get stuck and need help, you have plenty of time to do so and meet the deadline.

## Part A How You Spend Your Time

One challenge developers face, moreso when they are starting out, is estimating how long something will take. Sometimes we don't account for merge conflicts, bugs, annoying Slack messages, and all the other things that interrupt our workflow or slow us down.

One challenge learners in a new environment/content area face is feeling like they know nothing, and until they know everything, they feel like they are failing.

So this week, we would like you to start self-monitoring your progress. Before you start on the technical work, reflect back on how the pre-work has gone so far.
- Have the time estimates matched up with your experience?

    No. So far, the estimates have been higher than the actual times it has taken me to complete the various pre-work sections. For example, Sections 1 and 3 are
    both estimated to take 6 - 10 hours to complete, but it only took me about 4 hours per section. Section 2, which was estimated at 8 - 12 hours, only took me
    about 6 hours. I attribute this to some general familiarity with the concepts that I had before I started Mod 0. If I hadn't known what a conditional was before
    getting started, then it may have taken some more time to wrap my head around the concepts.

- When you sit down to start working, do you have a clear goal of what you want to accomplish and in how much time? If so, how aligned is that to what actually happens?

    Yes and no. For the pre-work sections, I have sat down with the intention to complete some amount of work based on the estimates listed at the beginning of the
    sections. So, when I sat down to begin work on Section 1, I set the intention of completing that section in the span of about 6 - 10 hours. When it only took
    4, I reassessed and decided to begin working on Section 2, as well as complete the Session 2 HW. So, my intentions are aligned with reality insofar as I have been
    able to complete what I set out to complete, but I have ended up with extra time each time I have sat down to work.

- How do you work best - in 2 hour blocks, 4 hour blocks, etc? Do you take breaks regularly? Do you have a system to hold yourself accountable to taking breaks?

    I work best in terms of goals, not necessarily in terms of time blocks. This is true in my work life and in the time I spend on hobbies.
    If I have a goal that I want to accomplish, then I will spend just about as much time as it takes. I am bad about taking regular breaks. Sometimes I will realize I have been sitting at my desk for a few hours without a break, just because I haven't hit what I think will be the right stopping point. For example, if I am recording
    a scratch track for one of my band's tunes, then I might sit down with the intention to get through the full A section, or the whole song, depending on the length. I
    hold myself accountable to these kinds of goals almost to a fault.

You've probably heard of the Pomodoro Technique in Mod 0 classes (and elsewhere, maybe!). During this final section of pre-work, we are going to ask that you follow this technique. Please read about it [here](https://www.dovico.com/blog/2020/08/26/the-pomodoro-technique-how-to-manage-your-work-time-and-flow-the-easy-way/). The article doesn't mention writing down Step 1, but we ask that you find a special spot in your notebook where you do this for each work session. In the deliverables, we will ask that you share what you wrote down for Step 1 of the technique each time you started a new task. _Note: if the 25 minutes on/3-5 minutes off isn't best for you, you do **not** have to follow that! The main focus of this is setting an intention and continuing to better understand your working style._

## Part B Classes

Today, you are going to be learning about Objects and Classes. In ruby, Classes are one of the tools we use to group together specific Methods that are meant to work together, or on the same type of Object. Arriving at Turing with a strong understanding of how to build a class, and how to call Methods on that class will make your first couple of weeks go smoothly!

When you are all done with the lessons, exercises, and questions for today, you will once again use git to save your work locally, and then send your work to Github.

1. Work through the following lessons. Any files that you create while working can be kept in today's `exercises` directory.

    - [X] [What Are Objects](https://launchschool.com/books/oo_ruby/read/the_object_model#whatareobjects) section from LaunchSchool.

    - [X] [Classes Define Objects](https://launchschool.com/books/oo_ruby/read/the_object_model#classesdefineobjects) section from LaunchSchool.
